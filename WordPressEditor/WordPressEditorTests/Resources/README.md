The reason why some PNG files in the folder have a .dat extension, is because it prevents
Xcode from compressing those images further when building the test target.

This allows us to compare the data in these files with the images generated by the tests.

To update any of these images simply execute in the console (with a well placed breakpoint):

    UIImagePNGRepresentation(image).write(to: URL(fileURLWithPath: "some/path"))
